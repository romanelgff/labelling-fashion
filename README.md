# CNN with Python

Creating a Conventional Neuronal Networks that classify and label fashion images. We want networks that recognise the clothes, from 16,000 coloured images (300x400 converted to 90x120) split into 3 main categories (glasses, trousers, shoes) and 17 subclasses. The objective is to return all labels associated with a given image. To solve the problem, we divided the task into smaller bits that we can solve independently (with different networks).

## Primary classification

## Distinguishing glasses from sunglasses in glasses/sunglasses category

## Finding the best method for the trousers/jeans category

### Two different methods

### Comparison of the methods
